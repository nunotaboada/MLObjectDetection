Coverage
========

This page shows the **code coverage report** generated with **pytest-cov**.  
The report indicates the percentage of the codebase exercised by the tests,  
highlighting which parts of the project are well tested and which areas may require additional test cases.  

A higher coverage value generally reflects greater confidence in the reliability of the implementation.
